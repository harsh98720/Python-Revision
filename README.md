# Python Mastery — Level-Wise Practice & Logic Building

## About
This repository documents my **level-wise Python revision**, focused on **logic, problem-solving, and real execution** instead of passive learning.

All tasks were completed without relying on shortcuts or heavy libraries, to ensure strong fundamentals and clarity of thought.

## Levels Overview

### Level 1 — Core Basics
- Conditions and loops
- Number logic (prime, even/odd, palindrome)
- Pattern problems
- Input handling

### Level 2 — Data Structures
- List operations without built-ins
- Duplicate removal logic
- Dictionary-based analysis
- Word frequency counter

### Level 3 — Functions & Recursion
- Iterative vs recursive approaches
- Fibonacci and performance discussion
- Recursive digit and number operations
- Function-based filters

### Level 4 — File Handling & Error Management
- File reading and writing
- Word and line counting
- Exception handling
- Error logging with timestamps

### Level 5 — Object-Oriented Programming
- BankAccount class design
- Constructors and instance variables
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Practical OOP decision making

### Level 6 — Mini Projects
- CLI To-Do Application
- Password Strength Validator
- Number Guessing Game
- File-based Student Result System

## Key Takeaways
- Syntax knowledge is useless without logic
- Avoiding built-ins exposes weak fundamentals
- Recursion must be used thoughtfully
- OOP is about structure, not theory
